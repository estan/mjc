MiniJava Compiler (`mjc`)
=========================

This is a compiler for a slightly modified version of the MiniJava
language described in Appel's *Modern Compiler Implementation in Java*.
It was created as part of the course *DD2488 Compiler Construction* at
KTH.

Building
--------

Type `ant` in the top-level directory. This will build the compiler
and unit tests, and produce `mjc.jar`. See `ant -projecthelp` for the
different available targets. Here's a hopefully up to date list:

    Main targets:
     clean    Delete all generated files
     compile  Compile all sources
     jar      Build compiler JAR file
     submit   Submit TAR archive to TIGRIS
     tar      Build compressed source-only TAR archive
     test     Run the unit tests
    Default target: jar

The compiler requires Java 7.

Running
-------
To run the compiler, type

    ./mjc foo.java -S

where `foo.java` is the MiniJava source file to be compiled. The available command
line options are:

    usage: mjc infile [options]
     -g         print abstract syntax tree (GraphViz)
     -h         show help message
     -o <arg>   output file
     -p         print abstract syntax tree
     -S         output assembler code

Hacking in Eclipse
------------------

To get started in Eclipse, make an initial build with Ant by typing `ant`,
then perform the following steps in a new or existing Eclipse workspace:

1. **File → New → Java Project**.
2. Enter **mjc** as **Project name**.
3. Uncheck **Use default location** and pick the **mjc** folder as **Location**.
4. Click **Next**.
7. Check the **Allow output folders for source folders** checkbox, and then press
   **Configure Output Folder Properties** for each of **build/parser-src**,
   **src/main/java** and **src/test/java** to configure the output folders as
   follows:
    * **build/parser-classes** for **mjc/build/parser-src**
    * **build/main-classes** for **mjc/src/main/java**, and
    * **build/test-classes** for **mjc/src/test/java**.
8. Make sure **src/test/resources** is not used as a source folder, since
   it just contains input tests for the parser.
9. Under the **Libraries** tab, remove **mjc.jar** from the build path.
10. Click **Finish** to create the project.

**That's it!**

### Suppressing Warnings in Generated Code
The sources in **build/parser-src** generated by SableCC have some warnings.
To suppress them, in the properties for the **build/parser-src** source folder,
under **Java Compiler**, check **Ignore optional compile problems**

This is only possible in Eclipse Juno or later. In Eclipse older versions,
you instead have to go into **Configure Contents...** in the **Problems**
panel menu and create a new **Scope** that covers a working set containing
only **src/main/java** and **src/test/java**, but not **build/parser-src**.
This will prevent the warnings from showing up in the **Problems** panel.
(The **Package Explorer** will still show an exclamation mark for the folder
though.)


Submitting to TIGRIS
--------------------

To create a compressed source-only TAR archive and submit it by e-mail to
the TIGRIS judging system, make sure the `TIGRIS_ID` and `TIGRIS_EMAIL`
environment variables are set to your TIGRIS ID and submission e-mail, then
type

    ant submit

You may also specify the ID and e-mail using the `-Dtigris.id` and
`-Dtigris.email` ANT options. This will override the values set by the
environment variables. By default the submission is sent to
`submit@tigris.csc.kth.se`. This may be changed using the `-Dtigris.to` option.

The target uses the script in `tools/submit`. The script depends on the
`uuencode` command from GNU sharutils and uses the `mail` command to send the
mail.

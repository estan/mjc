MiniJava Compiler TODO
======================

In roughly descending order of priority:

1. Update grammar to handle additional comparison/logical operators.
2. Decide which extensions we want to aim for and update grammar.
3. Create a visitor for building the symbol table.
4. Create a visitor for doing type checking.
5. Check integer constant sizes.

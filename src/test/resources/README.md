Compiler Test Programs
======================

This directory and its subdirectories contain input programs for the various
compiler tests. The tests are organized as follows:

* **compile** contains programs that should compile without problems.
* **noncompile/syntax** contains programs with syntax errors.
* **noncompile/symbol** contains programs with symbol errors.
* **noncompile/type** contains programs with type errors.
* **execute** contains programs that should compile and run without problems,
* **nonexecute** contains programs that should compile but which exhibit runtime
  errors.
* **shared** contains a selection of tests that we will submit as part of
  project examination.

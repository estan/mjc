MiniJava Programs with Symbol Errors
====================================

These are syntactically valid MiniJava programs but which contain "symbol errors"
such as:

* Reclarations of classes, fields, methods, parameters and local variables.
* Uses of undeclared types in field, method, parameter and local variable declarations.
* Wrong main method name in main class (i.e. not "main").

They serve as input for the symbol table builder tests.

DD2488 Test Cases
=================

These are the test we will submit as part of the course examination.

Tests here come in 4 categories:

* **compile** valid Minijava code with or without course extensions
* **noncompile** invalid Minijava code that should not pass a correct compiler
* **execute** like **compile**, but these also execute and output some result.
* **nonexecute** like **compile**, but performs some nasty operation, typically
  an array-out-of-bounds operation (i.e., relies on an extension).
